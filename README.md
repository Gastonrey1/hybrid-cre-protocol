## 🧠 What is Hybrid CRE?

**Hybrid Computational Reflective Equilibrium (Hybrid CRE)** is a **constitutional decision architecture for AI systems**.  
Instead of treating alignment as a scalar optimization problem, Hybrid CRE structures artificial decision-making through **jurisdictional logic, procedural safeguards, and institutional review mechanisms**.

The protocol enables AI systems to resolve normative conflicts using **structured governance processes**, not just reward shaping or post-hoc oversight.

This repository provides the **official reference implementation** of the Hybrid CRE computational protocol.

## 🧩 System Overview

Hybrid CRE is composed of three core institutional modules:

### **SIS — Systemic Impact Score**
Evaluates the **cross-domain systemic consequences** of candidate decisions.  
SIS models how actions propagate across institutional, social, and regulatory layers.

### **ATC — Alignment Traceability Code**
Maintains the **decision lineage** and justificatory chain.  
ATC ensures every output can be traced to procedural, normative, and jurisdictional inputs.

### **Habeas Log**
A procedural safeguard enabling **jurisdictional review** of automated decisions.  
It functions as a constitutional oversight layer, allowing institutional validation and conflict resolution.

Together, these modules form a **computational analogue of checks and balances**.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

This repository exists to:

- Provide a **reference computational model** of the Hybrid CRE protocol  
- Enable **reproducibility of governance simulations**  
- Serve as a baseline for **institutional AI alignment research**  
- Support development of **constitutional AI architectures**

## ⚙️ Conceptual Architecture

Hybrid CRE models AI governance as an **institutional process** rather than a control parameter.  
Key principles include:

- Jurisdictional structuring of decision authority  
- Procedural review instead of scalar constraint stacking  
- Institutional traceability  
- Normative conflict resolution through layered oversight  

The system operationalizes a **computational form of constitutional order**.
