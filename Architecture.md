# Hybrid CRE — System Architecture

Hybrid Computational Reflective Equilibrium (Hybrid CRE) models AI alignment as an **institutional decision architecture** rather than an optimization constraint.  
The system structures artificial decision-making through jurisdictional layering, procedural safeguards, and traceable justificatory chains.

---

## 🏛️ Architectural Principle

Hybrid CRE operates as a **computational analogue of constitutional order**.  
Instead of embedding alignment solely in reward functions or policy filters, the protocol distributes decision authority across structured modules that simulate institutional roles:

- Impact evaluation  
- Procedural traceability  
- Jurisdictional review  

This creates a system of **computational checks and balances**.

## 🧩 Module Roles

### **1. SIS — Systemic Impact Score**

**Function:**  
Evaluates the potential cross-domain consequences of candidate decisions.

**Purpose:**  
Moves alignment assessment from local optimization to **system-level impact modeling**, considering:

- Regulatory effects  
- Institutional stability  
- Cross-domain propagation  

SIS acts as the **impact assessment branch** of the architecture.

---

### **2. ATC — Alignment Traceability Code**

**Function:**  
Records the justificatory and procedural lineage of decisions.

**Purpose:**  
Ensures every decision can be reconstructed in terms of:

- Normative inputs  
- Jurisdictional authority  
- Procedural path  

ATC serves as the **record-keeping and transparency branch**, analogous to institutional documentation and legal reasoning chains.

---

### **3. Habeas Log**

**Function:**  
Provides a structured mechanism for jurisdictional review and procedural validation.

**Purpose:**  
Acts as a **computational safeguard** that allows:

- Institutional oversight  
- Conflict-of-authority resolution  
- Suspension or escalation of decisions when jurisdictional incoherence is detected  

The Habeas Log is the **review branch** of Hybrid CRE.

---

## ⚖️ Jurisdictional Layering

Hybrid CRE does not treat decisions as flat outputs.  
Each decision exists within a **jurisdictional context**, which determines:

- Which norms apply  
- Which institutional layer has authority  
- Whether procedural review is required  

This prevents alignment from collapsing into a single scalar metric and instead models governance as **structured authority distribution**.

---

## 🔍 Normative Conflict Handling

When conflicts arise:

1. **SIS** evaluates systemic implications  
2. **ATC** preserves the decision’s normative lineage  
3. **Habeas Log** enables review when jurisdictional inconsistency is detected  

Conflict resolution occurs through **procedural pathways**, not ad hoc overrides.

## 🧠 Architectural Shift Introduced by Hybrid CRE

| Conventional Alignment | Hybrid CRE Architecture |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Reward shaping         | Jurisdictional structuring |
| Constraint stacking    | Procedural review layers |
| Output filtering       | Institutional decision flow |
| Scalar optimization    | Multi-layer governance process |

Hybrid CRE reframes AI alignment as **institutional computation**.

---

## 🏗️ System Character

Hybrid CRE is:

- Not a policy filter  
- Not a single metric  
- Not a post-hoc audit tool  

It is a **decision architecture** designed to embed governance structure directly into computational processes.
