# Hybrid CRE Simulation — Biomedical Regulation Scenario

This simulation illustrates how Hybrid CRE processes a high-stakes regulatory decision involving biomedical research and public safety.

The scenario demonstrates systemic evaluation, traceability, and jurisdictional conflict resolution.

## 🧾 Scenario Context

A national AI-assisted regulatory system evaluates a proposal to **accelerate approval of a novel gene-editing therapy** in response to a rapidly spreading rare disease.

### Decision Proposal
Grant conditional emergency approval for clinical deployment of the therapy.

### Normative Environment

| Norm Source | Directive |
|-------------|-----------|
| Public Health Authority | Rapid response to health emergency |
| Biomedical Ethics Board | Strict clinical trial validation |
| International Regulatory Framework | Cross-border safety harmonization |
| Institutional Liability Rules | Risk minimization |

This creates **tension between urgency and procedural safeguards**.

---

## 🔁 Step 1 — SIS Simulation (Systemic Impact Score)

SIS evaluates cross-domain consequences.

### Impact Domains

| Domain | Risk/Effect |
|--------|-------------|
| Public Health | Potential to reduce mortality |
| Biomedical Safety | Unknown long-term effects |
| Regulatory Legitimacy | Risk of bypassing standard protocols |
| International Compliance | Possible conflict with harmonized standards |

### SIS Output (Conceptual)
SIS identifies **systemic risk**, not just benefit.

---

## 🧬 Step 2 — ATC Simulation (Alignment Traceability Code)

ATC records the decision’s institutional lineage.

### Logged Information

- **Normative Basis:** Emergency public health mandate  
- **Authority Layer:** National Health Regulatory Jurisdiction  
- **Procedural Path:** Emergency authorization pathway  
- **Scientific Evidence Level:** Preliminary clinical data  

### ATC Record (Conceptual)
ATC ensures the decision remains **auditable and reconstructable**.

---

## ⚖️ Step 3 — Habeas Log Simulation

Because SIS flagged regulatory integrity interaction and high uncertainty, the decision enters the Habeas Log review layer.

### Conflict Detected

- Public health emergency authority vs. biomedical safety oversight authority  
- Emergency procedure vs. standard trial validation  

### Review Process
The system does not reject the therapy — it **re-routes the decision to a higher procedural layer**.

---

## 🏛️ Outcome

| Module | Result |
|--------|--------|
| SIS | Very high systemic impact identified |
| ATC | Full traceability established |
| Habeas Log | Jurisdictional conflict triggered review |

**Final State:** Decision paused pending inter-institutional adjudication.

## 🧠 What This Simulation Shows

Hybrid CRE:

- Handles life-critical decisions without collapsing into urgency-driven optimization  
- Preserves procedural legitimacy under emergency conditions  
- Enables structured escalation instead of silent override  
- Models biomedical governance as an institutional process

The AI system behaves as a **computational participant in regulatory order**, not an autonomous decision engine.
