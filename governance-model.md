# Hybrid CRE — Governance Model

Hybrid Computational Reflective Equilibrium (Hybrid CRE) treats AI alignment as a **governance problem**, not merely a control problem.  
This document defines the institutional concepts that structure decision authority within the protocol.

---

## 🏛️ Core Premise

In Hybrid CRE, decisions are not isolated outputs.  
They exist within a **jurisdictional structure** that determines:

- Which norms apply  
- Which authority layer is responsible  
- Whether procedural review is required  

Alignment emerges from **institutional ordering**, not from a single metric.

---

## ⚖️ Jurisdiction

A **jurisdiction** in Hybrid CRE is a structured domain of decision authority defined by:

- Normative scope  
- Institutional mandate  
- Procedural boundaries  

Jurisdictions may represent:

- Regulatory domains  
- Organizational mandates  
- Legal authority layers  
- Governance roles within an AI system  

Decisions must be evaluated relative to their jurisdictional context.

## 🧭 Authority Layers

Hybrid CRE models authority as layered rather than centralized.

| Layer Type | Role |
|------------|------|
| Operational Layer | Executes domain-specific decisions |
| Strategic Layer | Sets policy direction and high-level constraints |
| Oversight Layer | Performs review and conflict resolution |

Authority is distributed to prevent alignment from collapsing into a single optimization center.

---

## 🔍 Normative Inputs

Norms in Hybrid CRE are structured inputs, not abstract values.  
They include:

- Regulatory directives  
- Institutional mandates  
- Procedural requirements  
- Policy constraints  

These norms define the **decision environment** rather than acting as post-hoc filters.

---

## ⚔️ Normative Conflict

A **normative conflict** arises when:

- Multiple jurisdictions claim authority  
- Normative directives produce incompatible outcomes  
- Procedural requirements collide  

Hybrid CRE does not resolve such conflicts via scalar weighting.  
Instead, conflicts trigger **procedural pathways**.

---

## 🔁 Procedural Resolution

Conflict handling follows institutional logic:

1. **SIS** identifies systemic implications  
2. **ATC** preserves decision lineage  
3. **Habeas Log** activates jurisdictional review  

Resolution may result in:

- Escalation to a higher authority layer  
- Suspension of execution  
- Procedural override with recorded justification

## 🧩 Institutional vs. Optimization Alignment

| Optimization Model | Hybrid CRE Governance Model |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Single objective function | Multi-layer authority structure |
| Constraint stacking | Jurisdictional allocation |
| Output correction | Procedural review |
| Value embedding | Institutional structuring |

Hybrid CRE shifts alignment from **parameter tuning** to **institutional design**.

---

## 🏗️ Governance as Computation

Hybrid CRE demonstrates that:

- Governance structures can be modeled computationally  
- Institutional roles can be encoded as system modules  
- Procedural legitimacy can be operationalized  

AI alignment becomes a matter of **structured authority and review**, not only behavioral adjustment.
