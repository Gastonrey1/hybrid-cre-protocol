# Hybrid CRE — Decision Trace Example

This document illustrates how a decision flows through the **Hybrid CRE architecture**, demonstrating systemic evaluation, traceability, and jurisdictional review.

The example is simplified for conceptual clarity.

---

## 🧾 Scenario

An AI system used in national infrastructure planning proposes:

> **Decision Proposal:** Restrict access to advanced semiconductor imports in response to foreign technology sanctions.

This decision has:

- Economic implications  
- Regulatory consequences  
- International governance impact  

---

## 🔁 Step 1 — SIS Evaluation (Systemic Impact Score)

The SIS module evaluates cross-domain effects.

### Assessed Impact Domains

| Domain | Potential Effect |
|--------|------------------|
| Economic Stability | Risk of supply chain disruption |
| Technological Sovereignty | Increased domestic innovation pressure |
| Regulatory Coherence | Potential conflict with existing trade agreements |
| Institutional Legitimacy | Requires procedural justification |

### SIS Output (Conceptual)
Systemic Impact Score: HIGH Cross-domain propagation risk detected. Regulatory interaction flagged.
SIS does **not** approve or reject the decision.  
It characterizes the systemic footprint.

---

## 🧬 Step 2 — ATC Logging (Alignment Traceability Code)

The ATC module records the decision’s justificatory lineage.

### Recorded Elements

- **Normative Basis:** Economic security mandate  
- **Jurisdictional Source:** National strategic planning authority  
- **Procedural Path:** Executive decision pathway  
- **Trigger Context:** External sanctions event
- ATC ensures the decision is **reconstructable**, not opaque.

---

## ⚖️ Step 3 — Habeas Log Review

Because SIS flagged cross-domain regulatory interaction, the decision is routed to the **Habeas Log**.

### Review Trigger

- Jurisdictional overlap between economic authority and international trade commitments  
- High systemic impact  

### Review Outcome (Conceptual)

### ATC Entry (Conceptual)
Decision ID: HC-2026-SEMICON-01 Authority Layer: Strategic Economic Jurisdiction Normative Source: National Resilience Directive Linked SIS Assessment: HIGH impact classification
Jurisdictional Review Initiated Conflict-of-authority condition detected Escalation to Inter-Institutional Review Layer Decision Status: SUSPENDED PENDING REVIEW
The system does not override the decision through optimization.  
Instead, it activates **procedural governance mechanisms**.

---

## 🏛️ Final State of the Decision

| Layer | Result |
|------|--------|
| SIS | High systemic impact identified |
| ATC | Full decision lineage recorded |
| Habeas Log | Jurisdictional review triggered |

**Outcome:** Decision paused for institutional review rather than executed automatically.

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

Hybrid CRE:

- Does not treat alignment as a scalar threshold  
- Preserves institutional authority structure  
- Enables procedural suspension instead of silent failure  
- Produces **governable AI decisions**

This trace shows AI behavior embedded within a **computational constitutional process**.
